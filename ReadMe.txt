1.) What I have done and what is missing? 

I have implemented the search and eveything works perfectly. Also all the data is handled if Physician is selected.
When you click on the link in the same browser tabs are created depending on what you clicked. You can then click on
the tabs. When tabs are opened the results shown are hidden but when you close the tabs by clicking th close button
the previous results are shown again. You can click on the button reset form to reset to default inputs as they were in
the beginning. 

I didn't implement the changing of locations depending on what you pick, instead they are all printed on one page.
Also, I didn't use Google Maps to find the longitude and latitude. And when in the people tab you cannot select
between sites and display information instead it is all displayed in one table.
